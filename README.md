# Robo Rally
## What is Robo Rally?
Robo rally is a multiplayer, digitized and simplified version of the old boardgame [robo rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboRally). You play as a robot and through picking programming cards that allow you to move, you try to pass 3 checkpoints. Falling into a pit, running into another robot and falling off the board will cause you to go back to your starting position. Additionally falling into a pit will cause you to lose health. 

In order to play you will need to signin and login. After that you can make a gameroom, join it and play once two people have joined. 

Robo Rally was built in a little over a week as a part of the codaisseur academy course
