Tileset is adapted from Bengt - FactoryTiles
full tileset at https://github.com/Bengt/FactoryTiles

I picked only some tiles for the conveyor from the full
tileset - we only need the minimum of 4 (there are many many more)
and tried to name them according to orientation N,S,W,E.

Robot tiles also have orientations which we need to account for.

I included the .png and the .svg versions of each tile, we will
need to decide which format to use (I assume svg is better - it is scalable,
but may take a bit more space?)
